- Math undergrad at Pusan National University; Undergraduate Research Student @ PNU Data Intelligence Lab.
- Focus: Non-parametric Continual Learning for LLM reasoning (training-free adaptation via external memory updates).
- I build graph-structured, stateful computation (persistent buffers, thought templates, `MetaGraph`) with validator-gated writes to prevent contamination/collapse.
- Metrics-first: stream-level amortization (`cost_per_solved`, break-even) and stability (contamination rate, collapse time).
- Toolkit: spectral graph theory (Laplacian, spectral gap), stochastic search (MCTS/bandits), and optimization. Links: [CV](CV.pdf) | https://github.com/PROFOUNDIVE/graph-bot
