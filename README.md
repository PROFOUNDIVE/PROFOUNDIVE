- Math undergrad focusing on formal foundations for LLM reasoning and memory.
- Researching graph-structured, stateful computation: persistent buffers, thought templates, and amortized inference.
- Mathematical toolkit: spectral graph theory (Laplacian filtering, spectral gap), stochastic search (MCTS), and optimization.
- Goal: rigorous, reproducible reasoning systems that trade off accuracy, cost, and reliability at scale.
